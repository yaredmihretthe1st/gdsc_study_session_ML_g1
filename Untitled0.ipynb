The model is trained on historical sensor data (e.g., temperature, vibration, motor cycles) that has been labeled with outcomes like \"normal operation\" or \"imminent failure.\" It learns the complex patterns in the sensor readings that precede a breakdown, enabling it to predict the failure label for new, incoming sensor data from active appliances.\n",

If the data comes only from appliances in a specific geographic region (with a certain climate), from high-usage commercial settings, or from a single manufacturer, the model will not generalize well to a different user's home appliance. This could lead to inaccurate predictions—either frequent false alarms for normal behavior or a complete failure to recognize a new failure mode.\n",
